# SkyRoads 3D Game

This is a simple version of SkyRoads made in C++ and OpenGL that presents elements of global lighting and texture application.

The project consists of 2 subprojects, one in which the **[gameplay part](https://github.com/CristiSandu/SkyRoads-HW1-2/tree/main/Source/Laboratoare/Tema2)** is implemented and another in which a **[more realistic note](https://github.com/CristiSandu/SkyRoads-HW1-2/tree/main/Source/Laboratoare/Tema3)** is added.

## GamePlay

As a game mode, our goal is to cover the greatest distance without falling off the platforms or hitting obstacles. As a player's point of view we have 2 views, one from the back and one from the side.

Game Control:

| Key   | Action                              |
| :---- | :---------------------------------- |
| W     | increase speed                      |
| S     | decrease speed                       |
| A     | go to left platform row             |
| D     | go to right platform row            |
| R     | increase cut off angle to spot light |
| T     | decrease cut off angle to spot light |
| Space | jump                                |
| O     | apear only spot lights              |
| P     | apear only punctiform lights        |
