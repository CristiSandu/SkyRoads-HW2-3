The project consists of 2 subprojects, one in which the **[gameplay part](https://github.com/CristiSandu/SkyRoads-HW1-2/tree/main/Source/Laboratoare/Tema2)** is implemented and another in which a **[more realistic note](https://github.com/CristiSandu/SkyRoads-HW1-2/tree/main/Source/Laboratoare/Tema3)** is added.

## GamePlay

As a game mode, our goal is to cover the greatest distance without falling off the platforms or hitting obstacles.
